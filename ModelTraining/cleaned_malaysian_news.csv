KINABALU: The RM442.3mil Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) Airport Development Plan, which will increase the capacity of KKIA Terminal 1 to 12 million passengers per annum (mmpa), is expected

on the plan to upgrade facilities at the second busiest airport in the country on Wednesday (Nov 27).</p><p>Also present was Sabah Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Seri Christina Liew.</p><p>In a statement released by the Ministry here, the plan involved upgrading the existing terminal building and pier extension (which includes a multi-storey carpark), airside infrastructure (to accommodate an additional seven aircraft), landside infrastructure (roadworks upgrading), and infrastructure works.</p><p>It was previously reported that KKIA exceeded the capacity threshold of 9 mppa in 2019 with a total of 9.4 mppa.</p><p>In the meantime, Mohd Izani said the RM45mil optimisation programme currently carried out at KKIA to enhance the terminal ambience and infrastructure at the airside area is expected to be completed in the middle of next year.</p><p>Hajiji, after the briefing by the MAHB delegation led by Mohd Izani at his Sri Gaya residence, responded positively and stated that it was high time for Malaysian airports to upgrade the facilities at KKIA Terminal 1 and Tawau Airport.</p><p>He expressed hope that the airport development plan will take off soon as the number of tourist arrivals to Sabah is picking up.</p><p>Liew meanwhile noted that more direct flights are coming to Sabah in November and December this year, however, did not elaborate.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mohd Izani, responding to a request to display a model of the KKIA Airport Development Plan at the airport for public viewing, stated that MAHB has to finalise the design first.</p><p> </p><p> </p>"

penalty or imprisonment for 30 to 40 years and not more than 12 strokes of the cane, upon conviction.</p><p>In her witness statement, Dr Dzureena also stated that based on the post-mortem

Dzureena acknowledged that it was and informed the court that the victim’s injuries were from head to toe, with injuries around the left and right arm, possibly indicating defensive wounds.</p><p>When asked by Nur Nisla to further elaborate on what could possibly be considered blunt force trauma, Dr Dzureena said that it refers to injuries caused by fall onto a hard surface, kicking, punching, impact with a blunt object or a combination of the above, which can cause damage to the underlying structures.</p><p><strong>Also read: </strong><a

striking or swinging a cable cord towards the deceased, does it fall under blunt force trauma?</p><p>Dr Dzureena: Yes.</p><p>Nur Nisla: Considering the injuries you have observed, in your opinion, if the deceased in this case was struck with cable cords, punched repeatedly all over his body, kicked at his waist and stomach area, kicked at his behind, his head was stomped on the floor and he was pushed to metal lockers. What is the action that could possibly cause the death of the deceased?</p><p>Dr Dzureena: All of the above, specifically the chest and soft tissue injuries in combination, caused the death of the deceased.</p><p>Meanwhile, the atmosphere at the Tawau High Court turned emotional when the fourth prosecution witness, Siti Hamidah Jumari, 45, also the victim’s mother could not hold back her tears and cried while being asked to identify a photograph of her late son.</p><p>She was only able to identify her late son in one photograph as she could not contain her grief when asked to do so by Nur Nisla.</p><p>The prosecution is led by DPPs Nur Nisla, Ng Juhn Tao, and Nur Batrisyia Mohd Khusri.</p><p>Eight of the 13 accused are represented by lawyers Datuk Ram Singh, Kamaruddin Mohmad Chinki, and Chen Wen Jye, while the remaining five are defended by Mohamad Zairi Zainal Abidin, Abdul Ghani Zelika, Vivian Thien, Jhassany P Kang, and Kusni Ambotuwo.</p><p>The trial continues tomorrow. – Bernama</p><p> </p><p> </p>"
